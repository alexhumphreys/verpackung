## Running

To build this project, run:

```
make build
```

To test this project, run:

```
make test
```

To create and run an executable, run:

```
make run-executable
```

There's some other `make` tasks for editing files (using `rlwrap` to make the repl behave better), and for docker and documentation. Take a look to see.

## Acknowledgments

The `/Verpackung/Derive` dir is from @ShinKage et al's work on the idris2-lsp.
